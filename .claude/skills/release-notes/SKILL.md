  Writes the release notes for the next DNN Manager release as docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md, in the structure every
  release uses (bold summary, Highlights, Other changes, Upgrading, Tested, link to the changelog), from the
  CHANGELOG.md entry, the commits since the previous tag and real test results - every claim checked against the
  code - and the release commit's message, ready to paste. The VS Code task "release (GitHub)" publishes that file as
  the GitHub release's notes. Use when asked to write, draft,
  update or review release notes, prepare a release or "the next release", or turn the Unreleased changelog entry
  into notes - and to redo a release whose tag is already made (a failed release workflow, one more change before
  anyone has it): the notes and changelog updated in place, then the task "release: redo (GitHub)".

# Release notes

The notes for a release are **`docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md`**. The VS Code task **release (GitHub)**
(`.github/scripts/publish-release.ps1`) publishes that file unchanged as the GitHub release's notes
(`.github/scripts/release-notes.ps1`), and builds it into the exe - so it is written and committed before the release.
The workflow on GitHub (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) only builds and tests the pushed tag. [`docs/release-notes/v1.6.0.md`](../../../docs/release-notes/v1.6.0.md) is the model: match
its structure, length and tone.

Readers are **people who use DNN Manager**, deciding whether to update and what changes for them - not developers.

## Workflow

1. **Find the version and the range.** The version is the one asked for; when none is, ask (there is no
   `<Version>` in `DnnManager.csproj` to raise or read - builds take the newest tag's). The previous release is the newest tag: `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`.
   When the version's own tag exists already, this is a **redo** - see [Redoing a release](#redoing-a-release)
   first.
2. **Collect what changed:**
   - the `## Unreleased` (or `## vX.Y.Z`) entry in `CHANGELOG.md` - the main source, written by hand;
   - `git log --no-merges --format="%h %s%n%b" <previous tag>..HEAD` - for what the changelog misses;
   - the diff (`git diff --stat <previous tag>..HEAD`, then the files) wherever an entry is unclear.
3. **Verify every claim against the code**: UI labels exactly as in the XAML, settings keys and defaults, paths,
   numbers. Drop what you can't confirm, or ask. Never describe a change that isn't in the range.
4. **Get the test results** - run the fast tests and read the counts:
   `dotnet test tests\DnnManager.IntegrationTests --filter "TestCategory!=Integration" --artifacts-path <temp folder>`.
   Compare with the previous notes' *Tested* section ("up from N"). Add the integration tests or manual checks only
   if they were really run - ask the owner what was tested by hand. The integration tests that run real sites (e.g.
   `DnnUpgradeTests`, DNN upgrades on IIS Express and a SQL Server container) go in as what they did and found, in
   the user's words: the versions, the content on the site, the result.
5. **Write `docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md`** in the structure below. The file name is the tag and the release title,
   so it must be exactly `v` + the version (`v1.7.0.md`, or `v1.7.0-rc.1.md` for a pre-release). If the changelog
   entry is still `## Unreleased`, offer to rename it `## vX.Y.Z`.
6. **Check it**: every relative link resolves, the changelog anchor exists, and
   `.github\scripts\release-notes.ps1 -Version X.Y.Z -OutFile <temp>\notes.md` shows the notes as GitHub will get
   them (relative links turned into links to the tag's files).
7. **Write the commit message** for the release commit (see [Commit message](#commit-message)) and give it in the
   report, ready to paste.
8. Report what the notes say, the commit message, and anything left unverified. Don't commit, tag or publish - the
   owner does, with the VS Code task **release (GitHub)** (`.github/scripts/publish-release.ps1`, see
   `docs/releasing.md`), which picks this file and a commit, builds both exes and publishes the release - or, for a
   redo, **release: redo (GitHub)** (below).

## Redoing a release

The version's tag is made already - its release workflow failed, or one more change is wanted - and the owner wants
the same version again, not the next one. `.github/scripts/redo-release.ps1` (the VS Code task
**release: redo (GitHub)**, see `docs/releasing.md#redo-a-release`) amends the release commit with the working copy,
pushes the branch, deletes the tag and its GitHub release, and releases the version again.

1. **Is a redo still right?** Look the release up:
   `curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases/tags/vX.Y.Z` (the repository is `origin`'s) - a
   404 means none is published (a draft isn't listed there). When it is published, give its date and the files'
   `download_count`s: DNN Manager updates only to a *newer* version, so whoever installed the first build is never
   offered the redone one. If anyone but the owner may have it, recommend the next version instead and let the owner
   decide.
2. **The range** is the tag before it to the working copy: the previous release is
   `git describe --tags --abbrev=0 vX.Y.Z^`, and the changes are its commits plus what isn't committed yet
   (`git status`, `git diff HEAD`) - the redo folds them into the release commit.
3. **Update in place**: the `## vX.Y.Z` entry in `CHANGELOG.md` (no new heading) and `docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md`
   get the new changes where they belong - a new highlight, a line in *Other changes*, an *Upgrading* note for a
   removed setting or changed behaviour. Run the fast tests again and update *Tested*.
4. **The commit message** keeps the format; give the updated one when the themes changed - the script asks for it
   (Enter keeps the old one).
5. **Show the plan, don't run it**: `.github\scripts\redo-release.ps1 -Version X.Y.Z -DryRun` changes nothing and
   prints what the redo would amend, push and delete - fine to run and report. The redo itself force-pushes the
   branch and deletes a release: only the owner runs it.

## Structure

```markdown
# DNN Manager X.Y.Z

**The release in a few words.** One or two sentences on what it does for the user.

## Highlights

### A theme, named by what the user gets
- What they can do now, and where (**UI name** in bold).

### Another theme
- ...

## Other changes
- Smaller changes, one line each.
- Fixed: a bug, described by what the user saw.

## Upgrading
Install over X.Y-1.x as usual. Your settings keep their format.
- Anything the user must do once, or that now works differently.

## Tested
- What was checked by hand, against what (e.g. a real DNN 10.3.3 site).
- All N fast automated tests pass, up from M. New ones cover ...

```

| Part | Rules |
|---|---|
| **Title** | `# DNN Manager X.Y.Z`, followed directly by the summary - no date, release link or download links (GitHub shows those next to the notes). |
| **Summary** | Starts with a bold phrase of 3-7 words, then 1-2 plain sentences. No version number, no "This release…". |
| **Highlights** | 3-6 `###` themes, the most important first; 2-7 bullets each. Group by what the user gets, not by code layer. |
| **Other changes** | Everything else worth knowing, one line each. Bug fixes go last, as `Fixed: …`. |
| **Upgrading** | Always present. First line: `Install over X.Y.x as usual.` plus whether settings keep their format or are upgraded. Bullets only for actions or changed behaviour - removed features, renamed settings, a step to run once. |
| **Tested** | Only real results. Leave the section out rather than guess. |
| **Changelog link** | Always the last line - nothing after it: no `---` separator, footer or note about earlier version numbers. The anchor is the heading in lower case without dots: `## v1.7.0` → `#v170`. Changelog headings carry no date. |

## Style

- Write for the user: "you", present tense, what they can do and where. Name UI elements exactly as on screen, in
  **bold**; files, folders, settings and commands in `code`.
- Concrete over vague: "folder sizes are only measured while the **Size** column is shown", not "improved
  performance". Give numbers only when measured.
- No commit hashes, class names, internal refactors or dependency bumps - unless they change what the user sees
  (then say what changes).
- No emoji, no marketing words ("powerful", "seamless", "exciting"), no filler introductions.
- UTF-8 without BOM, CRLF line endings, like the rest of the repository.

## Commit message

One line - no body. It follows the repository's release commits (`git log --grep "^release:"`):

```text
release: vX.Y.Z - <the Highlights' themes, lower case, comma-separated>
```

- `release: vX.Y.Z - ` and the release's themes, a few words each, in the order of the Highlights - e.g.
  `release: v1.7.0 - self-update, workspace restore, keyboard and command palette, VS Code look, customizable layout`.
- No full stop, no body, no bullets: what changed is in the notes and the changelog.
- Give it in a `text` code block in the report, so it can be pasted into `git commit` or the VS Code commit box as is.
